<strong>Beta for my book on Augustine, the Holy Spirit, and the Filioque Controversy</strong>


In the summer of 2014, I finished an undergraduate thesis for college. I had wanted to turn the thesis into a book for the general public, but I lost interest.

But I have decided to pursue that project again and start looking it over.

If you would like to read what I have right now, feel free. If you would like to suggest improvements, even better!
